# Convolution dataset (MobileNets)

Dataset for convolution programs.

The shapes are taken from MobileNets: https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861. 

AUTOGENERATED!
The `shape-*` files are automatically generated from the `data.csv` file via the `tool-prepare-dataset` program.
Please do not edit any of the `shape-*` files manually. Please edit `data.csv` and re-run `tool-prepare-dataset` instead.
