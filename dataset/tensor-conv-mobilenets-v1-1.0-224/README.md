# Convolution dataset (MobileNets-v1-1.0-224)

Dataset for convolution programs.

The shapes are taken from MobileNets: https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861. 

**NB** While the same shapes can also be found in `dataset:tensor-conv1x1-mobilenets`
and `dataset:tensor-conv3x3-mobilenets`, it is convenient to keep all the
shapes for the most frequently used `1.0-224` model in one dataset.

AUTOGENERATED!
The `shape-*` files are automatically generated from the `data.csv` file via `program:tool-prepare-dataset`.
Please do not edit any of the `shape-*` files manually. Please edit `data.csv` and re-run `tool-prepare-dataset` instead.
